# Search long paths

Since the native search of VS Code cannot look in paths longer than 260 characters on Windows, I made this extension. It's multithreaded and can handle tens of thousands of results.

## Thanks

Big thanks to [potatoqualitee](https://github.com/potatoqualitee) for their work on [vscode-filename-search](https://github.com/potatoqualitee/vscode-filename-search) which I used as a starting point.
